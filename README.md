The API... I LOVE THE API!! Here is my first API connection, using the very good development that THEMOVIEDB did at their own API (superThanks! [themoviedb.org]). In here my objectives was:

1. To be able to get data from an external API source, and bring that data to my project.

2. To design the functions about filtering for search and indexate.

3. Also, to bring the user the individual point to a film.
